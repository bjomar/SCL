# SCL
Simple Callback Library

This is a very simple and basic callback library written in C++, made as dynamic as my skills allow it.

This library is developed and tested mainly under Windows, I will try to have it working under at least Linux/Unix as well.

## How to use?

Simply download and add the header files and include "SCL.h" to your project.
